# **Group project in TKP4120 chemical process engineering**
## **Simulation of a *post combustion* CO2-capturing process**
---
## **Introduction**

This repository contains python scripts and data for simulating the process of CO2-capture through dissolution and subsequent absorbtion of CO2 from combustion gasses in an aqueous solution containing monoethanolamine(MEA).\
Through a series of consecutive unit operations the CO2 is stripped from the solution, and the MEA is recycled for reuse in the absorption of CO2 from the stream of combustion gasses.

### Scope
---
The project entails the setup and solving of mass balances for every component in streams 1-9.\
Furthermore the program will solve equations for heating and cooling-requirements for each stream and unit operation.\
Some assumpions:
- Gasses behave ideally
- Only CO2 dissolves into the MEA solution
- The MEA solution does no evaporate
- The data in the supplied datafile is correct
