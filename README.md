# **Numerical simulation of *post combustion* CO~2~ capture**
---
## **Introduction**

This repository contains python scripts and data for simulating the process of CO2-capture through dissolution of CO2 from combustion gasses in an aqueous solution containing monoethanolamine(MEA).\
Through a series of consecutive unit operations the CO2 is stripped from the solution, and the MEA is recycled for reuse in the absorption of CO2 from the stream of combustion gasses.

### Scope
---
The project entails the setup and solving of mass balances for every component in streams 1-9.\
Furthermore the program will solve equations for heating and cooling-requirements for each stream and unit operation.
